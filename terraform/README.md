# AWS terraform infra

This is our AWS infrastructure, all our long term instances on AWS are created by this terraform configs. Currently includes:

* Nginx: 1 t2.small
* Prometheus: 1 t2.xlarge
* Stability test: pd(3 t2.micro) + tidb(1 t2.micro) + tikv(15 t2.micro)
* Binlog stability test: pump(10 m3.medium) + drainer(1 m3.large)

With [graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org) installed, we can generate a graph of all AWS resources by `terraform graph | dot -Tpng > aws.png`


**Note**:

1. This is our online services, please **never never never** run `terraform destroy` in this directory.

2. And before running `terraform apply`, running `terraform plan` to see what resources will be added/changed/destroyed is a good habit. This will help to prevent you from doing stupid things.

3. In order to not confuse terraform, always pull the latest configs before you change infra and when changes are done remember to push your modifications to github, so others can keep in sync.

4. Lower version terraform won't execute any command on terraform.tfstate generated by higher version terraform. We currently use **terraform 0.7.11**
